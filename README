This repo holds python scripts to learn introductory python concepts. The code
content follows the curriculum of the online courses provided by Georgia Tech
through edx.org. Addtionally, the code itself is often derivative of the code
given as examples throughout the courses. My comments are only brief 
explanations of concepts. For more in depth explanations, I suggest you check
out the Python Fundamentals courses provided by edx.org.
